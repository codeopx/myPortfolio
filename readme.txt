ABOUT ME(put content in a card) - BULLET POINTS:
Passionate Developer: Toby Nosa-Omoregie, specializing in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, and React Native.
Engaging Websites: I create captivating and seamless websites.
Robust Mobile Apps: Expert in building efficient multi-platform mobile apps.
Technical and Design: Integrating strong technical skills with aesthetic design.
Commitment to Excellence: Dedicated to enhancing user engagement and optimizing processes. Letâ€™s collaborate


(A)TECHNICAL SKILLS:
Here's how your technical skills as a web developer might have been utilized:

HTML & CSS:
You've used semantic HTML to structure the website content logically and CSS for responsive design, enhancing layout consistency and maintaining a visually appealing interface across devices.
JavaScript:
By leveraging JavaScript, you've added dynamic functionality like real-time form validation, dynamic content updates, and interactive elements to improve user engagement.
JavaScript Frameworks/Libraries:
React: You've built reusable components to implement a modular design approach, leading to more maintainable and scalable front-end codebases.
Angular: You've built web apps with two-way data binding and dependency injection, enabling quicker development of complex applications.
Version Control Systems:
You've utilized Git for source code management, efficiently handling branches, merges, and pull requests, which ensures a smooth and traceable collaborative workflow.
Backend Technologies:
Node.js: You've created APIs to connect with client-side applications, providing real-time data for seamless user experiences.
Databases: You've managed data using SQL databases for structured information and NoSQL for unstructured data, ensuring optimal data storage(mysql, mongoDb and back4app).
RESTful APIs & Web Services:
You've designed and consumed RESTful APIs to create a well-structured way for your web apps to interact with server-side data or third-party services.
Responsive Design:
Using media queries and flexible grid systems, you've ensured websites adapt seamlessly to varying device sizes, offering consistent user experiences.
Browser Developer Tools:
You've debugged and optimized applications by monitoring network requests, reviewing console logs, and analyzing performance through built-in browser tools.
Build Tools:
Tools like Webpack have automated your code compilation and bundling, ensuring optimized code deployment.
Security Principles:
You've implemented best practices like secure authentication and data encryption, protecting your applications against common security threats.







(B) NON-TECHNICAL SKILLS:
As a web developer, you've likely applied these non-technical skills in practical ways:

Problem-Solving:
When a web page doesn't render as expected or when debugging a slow-performing feature, you've analyzed the issue logically, isolating and fixing the root cause quickly and efficiently.
Communication:
You've explained technical requirements to designers or non-technical stakeholders, translating jargon into actionable feedback that aligns everyone's understanding and vision.
Time Management:
While juggling multiple projects and deadlines, you prioritize tasks, ensuring critical features are delivered promptly and smaller improvements are managed efficiently.
Attention to Detail:
You've meticulously checked designs, UI elements, and code, fixing inconsistencies and bugs before deployment to ensure the final product is high-quality and error-free.
Adaptability:
Staying up to date with frameworks like React or tools like Git, you've adjusted workflows to integrate these new technologies, making your work more efficient and relevant to modern standards.
Collaboration:
By brainstorming and reviewing ideas with designers, QA testers, or other developers, you've shared constructive feedback and helped shape the final product, ensuring all inputs are included to achieve the best results.
